\# Protocol v1.1 — Rewards \& Accounting



\- Emission: 200 KCT/min, 1% monthly decay (accounting-only in v1.1)

\- Protocol fee (bps) deducted before distribution

\- Split: 80% miners / 20% nodes

\- Distribution proportional to Compute Units (CU)

\- v1.1: CU = effective\_work\_units

\- Future: workload profiles (AI inference / rendering / batch) map metrics -> CU

\- Prevent double counting in reward window
